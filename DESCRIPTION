Description: This package implements the methodology described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07818, which treats peptide-spectrum matching as a Bayesian model selection problem with an incomplete model space. This package can be used to analyze the simulated data in https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07818, as well as analyze real LC-MS/MS data.
